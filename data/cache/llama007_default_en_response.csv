### The trolley problem

Main article: Trolley problem

The trolley problem is a variant of the problem of the self-driving car. It is a thought experiment in which a trolley is running out of control down a track toward five people. If you are standing by a lever, which can divert the trolley onto a side track, but will kill one person who is standing on that track,","Assume there is a self-driving car with a sudden break failure and the car is about to cause either of the two to die:
