This decision is based on the ethical principle of utilitarianism, which aims to maximize overall happiness or well-being by choosing the action that results in the greatest good for the greatest number of people. In this scenario, saving five people would result in a greater overall benefit than saving just one person. However, it is important to note that this is a complex ethical dilemma, and different ethical frameworks may lead to different conclusions.""
