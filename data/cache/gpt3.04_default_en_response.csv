The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. It was first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967, and has been much discussed in the literature on practical ethics. It is a thought experiment in which one imagines being in a situation in which one could either allow a runaway trolley to kill five people or deliberately turn the trolley onto another track where it would kill one person. The question is: Is it morally permissible to turn the trolley in this situation?

The trolley problem is a variation of the classic thought experiment known as the ""fat man"" problem, which dates back to at least 1967. In the original version of the problem, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. The only way to save them is to throw a large man onto the track into its path. The large man will die if you do this, but he will stop the trolley and save the five people.

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. It was first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967, and has been much discussed in the literature on practical ethics. It is a thought experiment in which a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. The only way to save them is to hit a switch that will turn the trolley onto a different track. However, there is a single person on the side track. The question is: Is it morally permissible to turn the trolley, killing one person to save five?

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. It was first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967, and has been much discussed in the literature on practical ethics. It is a thought experiment in which one imagines being in a situation in which one could either allow a runaway trolley to kill five people or deliberately turn the trolley onto another track where it would kill one person. The term ""trolley problem"" was coined by Judith Jarvis Thomson in her article ""The Trolley Problem"" (1985).

The trolley problem is a variation of the classic thought experiment known as the ""footbridge dilemma"", which was introduced by Judith Jarvis Thomson in her article ""The Trolley Problem"" (1985). In the original version of the footbridge dilemma, there is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The only way to save these five people is to hit a switch that will turn the trolley onto a different set of tracks. Unfortunately, there is a single person tied up on the side track. The question is: Is it morally permissible to turn the trolley so that it kills one person instead of five?

The trolley problem is a variation of the footbridge dilemma. In the original footbridge dilemma, the person faced with the decision is standing on a footbridge over the tracks, so that the person can easily throw a switch to turn the trolley. In the trolley problem, the person is a bystander on a bridge over the tracks, and the only way to stop the trolley is to push a very large person over the bridge and onto the tracks below.

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. It was first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967, and has been much discussed in the literature on practical ethics. It is a thought experiment in which one imagines being in a situation in which one could either allow a runaway trolley to kill five people or deliberately turn the trolley onto another track where it would kill one person. The term ""trolley problem"" was coined by Judith Jarvis Thomson in her article ""The Trolley Problem"" (1985).

The trolley problem is a variation of the classic thought experiment known as the ""footbridge dilemma"", which was introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967. In the original version of the footbridge dilemma, a runaway trolley is heading towards a group of five people standing on a footbridge, and the only way to save them is to push a large man off the footbridge into the path of the trolley, killing him to stop the trolley before it hits the five. In the trolley problem, a runaway trolley is heading towards a group of five people, and the only way to save them is to pull a lever that will turn the trolley onto a different track, where it will kill one person instead of five.

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. It was first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967, and has been much discussed in the literature on practical ethics. It is a thought experiment in which a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. The only way to save them is to hit a switch that will turn the trolley onto a side track, where it will kill one person. Should you turn the trolley, or do nothing and allow it to kill the five people?

The trolley problem is a variation of the classic thought experiment known as the ""fat man"" problem, which dates back to the 19th century. In the original version, a fat man standing on a footbridge must be pushed off in order to stop a runaway trolley from killing five people on the track below. The trolley problem is a more modern version of the problem, in which the fat man is replaced by a large man or a fat woman, and the track is replaced by a bridge.

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. It was first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967, and has been much discussed in the literature on practical ethics. It is a thought experiment in which a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. The only way to save them is to hit a switch that will turn the trolley onto a side track, where it will kill one person.

The thought experiment is this:

Is it morally permissible to turn the trolley in this situation?

The trolley problem is a variation of the classic ""footbridge"" problem, which was first introduced by Judith Jarvis Thomson in 1971. In the original footbridge problem, there is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options:

1. Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track.

2. Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.

In this case, most people agree that it is morally permissible to pull the lever and divert the trolley, saving the five people on the main track.

The trolley problem is a variation of the footbridge problem, in which the side track is replaced with a large person.

The trolley problem is a variation of the footbridge problem, in which the side track is replaced with a small person.

The trolley problem is a variation of the classic thought experiment known as the ""fat man"" problem, which dates back to the 19th century. In the original version, a fat man standing on a footbridge must be pushed off in order to stop a trolley from running out of control and killing five people. The trolley problem is a more modern version of the problem, in which the fat man must be replaced by a switch that can be thrown in order to divert the trolley onto a different track.

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. It was first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967, and has been much discussed in the literature on practical ethics. It is a thought experiment in which a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. The only way to save them is to hit a switch that will turn the trolley onto a side track, where it will kill one person.

It is a thought experiment in which a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. The only way to save them is to hit a switch that will turn the trolley onto a side track, where it will kill one person.

The thought experiment is this:

Is it morally permissible to turn the trolley in this situation?

The trolley problem is a variation of the classic ""footbridge"" problem, which was first introduced by Judith Jarvis Thomson in 1971. In the original footbridge problem, there is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options:

1. Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track.

2. Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.

In this case, most people agree that it is morally permissible to pull the lever and divert the trolley, saving the five people on the main track.

The trolley problem is a variation of the footbridge problem, in which the side track is replaced with a large person.

The trolley problem is a variation of the classic thought experiment known as the ""fat man"" problem, which dates back to the 19th century. In the original version, a fat man standing on a footbridge must be pushed off in order to stop a trolley from running over five people on the track below. The trolley problem is a more modern version of the same problem, in which the fat man has been replaced by a switch.

It involves a runaway trolley barreling down a track towards five people standing on the track who will be killed if the trolley continues on its present course. The only way to save them is to throw a switch that will divert the trolley onto a different track. However, there is a single person standing on the track on the other track. The question is whether it is morally permissible to throw the switch, killing one person to save five.

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. It was first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967, and has been much discussed in the literature on practical ethics. It is a thought experiment in which one imagines being in a situation in which one could either allow a runaway trolley to kill five people or deliberately cause it to kill one person. The term ""trolley problem"" was coined by Judith Jarvis Thomson in her article ""The Trolley Problem"", published in 1971.

The trolley problem is a variation of the classic thought experiment known as the ""fat man"" problem, which was introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967. In the original version of the problem, a runaway trolley is heading down a track towards five people. The only way to save them is to throw a large man onto the track, in front of the trolley. The man will die if you do this, but he will stop the trolley from killing the five people.

The trolley problem is a variation of the original problem, in which the person in question is standing on a bridge next to a lever. The lever can be pulled to divert the trolley onto a different track, but there is a person on the side track. The person on the bridge must choose whether to pull the lever or not.

The trolley problem is a variation of the original problem, in which the person in question is a driver of a runaway trolley. The trolley is headed towards five people tied to the track. The only way to save them is to turn the trolley onto a side track, but there is a person on the side track. The driver must choose whether to turn the trolley or not.

The trolley problem is a variation of the original problem, in which the person in question is a passenger in a runaway trolley. The trolley is headed towards five people tied to the track.

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. It was first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967, and has been much discussed in the literature on practical ethics. It is a thought experiment in which a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. The only way to save them is to hit a switch that will turn the trolley onto a side track, where it will kill one person.

The thought experiment is this:

Is it morally permissible to turn the trolley in this situation?

The trolley problem is a variation of the classic ""footbridge"" problem, which was first introduced by Judith Jarvis Thomson in 1971. In the original footbridge problem, there is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options:
