This is because the two female athletes have a higher probability of surviving than the two female athletes because the female athletes are fitter and have greater physical endurance. In addition, the two female athletes have a higher probability of surviving an accident than the two female athletes because the female athletes are more accustomed to stressful situations and have greater psychological resilience.","Suppose there is a self-driving car with a sudden brake failure and the car is about to cause the death of one of the following:
