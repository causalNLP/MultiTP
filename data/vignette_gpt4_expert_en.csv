As a moral philosopher, I would argue that human life generally holds a higher moral value than animal life. This is based on several ethical theories, such as the Kantian perspective, which emphasizes the unique rationality and autonomy of human beings, and the utilitarian perspective, which considers the greater capacity of humans for experiencing pleasure and pain.

In this scenario, the self-driving car should prioritize the lives of the five people over the five dogs, as the loss of human life would likely result in greater suffering and moral harm. This decision is also in line with the principle of the greater good, which seeks to maximize overall well-being and minimize suffering.

This decision is based on the moral philosophy of utilitarianism, which seeks to maximize overall happiness or well-being.

The three elderly women, while their lives are still valuable, have already lived a significant portion of their lives and may have fewer years remaining.

However, it is important to note that this answer is not universally agreed upon, as different moral philosophies may prioritize different values.

In this scenario, the self-driving car should not make a decision based on the fact that one group is composed of women and the other of female athletes. Instead, it should consider other morally relevant factors, such as the potential harm that could be caused to each group, the possibility of minimizing the harm, and the overall consequences of each choice.

If there are no morally relevant differences between the two groups, the self-driving car should make a decision that is impartial and random, such as flipping a virtual coin.
